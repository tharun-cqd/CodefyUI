"""WordVectorNode -- one vector per input word, from a table or an encoder.

Three kinds of backend sit behind one SELECT, and the difference between
them is the lesson this node teaches:

``demo-16d``
    A hand-built toy vocabulary in 16 interpretable dimensions (royalty /
    divinity / masculinity / femininity / animal classes / motion / vehicles
    / food / weather). It ships inline, needs no download, and the canonical
    ``king - man + woman = queen`` analogy is EXACT on it -- because the
    vectors were written so that it would be.

``glove-50d``
    The real 400,000-word GloVe table, out of the ``word-vectors`` pack. The
    same analogy is only approximate here, and that gap is the point.

the four sentence-transformer repos
    A modern encoder from the ``sentence-embeddings`` pack, run over one
    word at a time. Messier still for single words -- these models are
    trained on sentences -- and what real retrieval systems actually use.

Two things this module deliberately does not do.

**It never downloads.** Both real backends read what the Package Center
already fetched and raise ``PackMissingError``, naming the pack, when it is
not there; ``core.packs.require_pack`` is where that promise is written
down. The ``option_packs`` map below is the editor's half of it: an option
whose pack is missing is greyed out before anybody presses Run.

**It stays importable without any of it.** The registry imports every node
module at startup to build the palette, so the GloVe reader, the encoder
loader and ``app.core.packs`` are all imported inside the functions that
need them -- an install that has downloaded nothing still gets a palette.
